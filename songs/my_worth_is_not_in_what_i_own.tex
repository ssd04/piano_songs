\beginsong{My Worth is Not in What I Own}[
]

\beginverse
My \[C]worth is not in \[F]what I \[C]own

Not \[C]in the strength of \[F]flesh and \[C]bone

But \[C]in the costly \[G]wounds of \[Am]love

\[F]At the cro\[C]ss
\endverse

\beginverse
My \[C]worth is not in \[F]skill or \[C]name

In \[C]win or lose, in \[F]pride or \[C]shame

But \[C]in the blood of \[G]Christ that \[Am]flowed

\[F]At the cro\[C]ss
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]I rejoice in \[G]my Re\[Am]deemer

Greatest Trea\[F]sure,

Wellspring of \[C]my \[G]soul

\[F]I will trust in \[G]Him, no \[Am]other.

My soul is \[C]satis\[F]fied in \[G]Him al\[C]one.
\endchorus

\beginverse
As summer flowers we fade and die

Fame, youth and beauty hurry by

But life eternal calls to us

At the cross
\endverse

\beginverse
I will not boast in wealth or might

Or human wisdom's fleeting light

But I will boast in knowing Christ

At the cross
\endverse

\beginchorus
I rejoice in my Redeemer

Greatest Treasure,

Wellspring of my soul

I will trust in Him, no other.

My soul is satisfied in Him alone.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Two wonders here that I confess

My worth and my unworthiness

My value fixed - my ransom paid

At the cross
\endverse

\beginchorus
I rejoice in my Redeemer

Greatest Treasure,

Wellspring of my soul

I will trust in Him, no other.

My soul is satisfied in Him alone.
\endchorus

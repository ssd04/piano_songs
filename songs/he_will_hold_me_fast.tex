\beginverse
\[G]When I fear my \[G/B]faith will \[C]fail,

Christ will \[D]hold me \[G]fast;

When the tempter \[G/B]would pre\[C]vail,

He will \[D]hold me \[G]fast.

\[Em]I could \[D]never \[G]keep my \[C]hold

Through life’s \[B]fearful \[Em]path;

For my \[D]love is often \[C]cold;

He must \[D]hold me \[G]fast.
\endverse


\beginchorus
\[C]He will \[D]hold me \[Em]fast,

He will \[D/F#]hold me \[G]fast;

\[G]For my \[Am]Savior loves \[Am7]me   \[C]so,

He will \[D]hold me \[G]fast.
\endchorus


\beginverse
Those He saves are His delight,

Christ will hold me fast;

Precious in His holy sight,

He will hold me fast.

He’ll not let my soul be lost;

His promises shall last;

Bought by Him at such a cost,

He will hold me fast.
\endverse 

\beginverse
For my life He bled and died,

Christ will hold me fast;

Justice has been satisfied;

He will hold me fast.

Raised with Him to endless life,

He will hold me fast

‘Till our faith is turned to sight

When He comes at last!
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]He will \[D]hold me \[Em]fast,

He will \[D/F#]hold me \[G]fast;

\[G]For my \[Am]Savior loves \[Am7]me   \[C]so,

He will \[D]hold me \[G]fast.

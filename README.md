# Songs with piano chords

Since i started to learn the piano, i've decided to compose a list of songs
that i like, and put them into a single pdf file using Latex.

## Dependencies

* `songs` latex package: a raw style file `songs.sty` was used and it's included in the repository

## Usage

The main operation are defined in the Makefile

* Compile latex document
```bash
make run
```

* View pdf content (using zathura)
```bash
make pdf
```
